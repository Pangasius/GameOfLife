This project is meant to create via python a customizable replica of the game "Game Of Life (And Death)".

To run it you need python(3.7), pygame and numpy.

Using those I tried my best to make an efficient program but I am still a newbie and I would really enjoy feedback or methods to make my code better.

Controls :
 Press T to create a random board (1/8 alive(blacks), 7/8 dead(whites))
 Press Q (french keyboard, A in the american) to switch a cell (under your mouse) beetween Alive (black)  and Dead (white).
 Hold A (french keyboard, Q in the american) to run the actual game once it's set up.
 You can always stop pressing A and change the state of any cell at any moment.

If the cycles are happening too quickly, change the value after fixedframes = , this will affect how quickly you switch the state of cells, be careful.

This code is using :
 A "Dead.png" image 10x10 pixels
 A "Alive.png" image 10x10 pixels
 A "logo32.png" image 32x32 pixels
Make sure you have them in the same folder (with the code) before launching

I think I've said everything, pardon my poor english and enjoy ;)
